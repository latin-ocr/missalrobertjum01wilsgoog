The leaf numbered 176 is now attached to the gathering b, and.
is reclroned as part ol that gathering in the collation given
above: but it seems not unlikely that the gutheringa originally
consisted ol four leaves, os which sol. 176 was the fourth, the
first leaf, separating the Sanctorale from the Votive Masses,
being either altogether blank, or more probably having on its
verso (iacing the ornamented first ,page oi the Votive Masses)
some adornment which led to its removal and to the detach·

Ascension, Pentecost, and the ieasts ol SS. Peter and Paul,
All Saints, and S. Andrew, each by one (see plates 1x-x1111).
In those cases where there is only one illumination the whole oi
the first page of the mass is written in gold, within an orna·
mental border: and this is the case also with the mass os
the Purification and with the mass de sancta T rinitate which
begins the series os Votive Masses' Several other masses have
their first words written in gold, but are not distinguished by
borders or illuminations.³ To this class belong the mass oi the
first Sunday oi Lent, oi the ieasts ol S. Stephen‚ S. John, the

removed. Themessos Palm Sundayis less highly ornamented: but it is possible
that here also a miniature hasbeen lost.
