INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

There is one other name in the same litany which may seem
to call sor a word ol explanation, though its presence gives no
indication ol the locality os the manuscript. lt is that ol S.
Martialis, who is invoked immediately aster, and in conjunction
with, the Apostles and Evangelists. He is no doubt to be
identified with S. Martialis, the reputed first bishop ol Limoges,
sometimes called “the Apostle os the Limousin,'¹ whom Gregory
of Tours mentions as one of the seven bishops sent srom Rome
to Gaul in the time os Decius A legend later than that
recorded by Gregory of Tours made him one ol the seventy
disciples of our Lord, and asserted that he had been sent to
Gaul by S. Peter. It was a debated point whether he should,
or should not, rank asan apostle, and his position in this Litany
implies the acceptance of the legend embodied in the 9th or
roth century Acta, and the admission ol the claim which was
sometimes made on his behalf to apostolic rank.

A lew words must be said upon the point (to which as
we have seen M. Pottier directs attention), os the insertion ol
S. Etheldreda’s name in the Canon, together with that oi Se
Gertrude.¹ Even taken in conjunction with such prominence
as is given in other parts of the manuscript to the Ely saints,
and to S. Etheldreda in particular, this insertion does not
appear by any means conclusive in favour ,οἱ Μ. Pottier's
theory. We have to account sor the presence, not ol one name,
but ol two: and the name os S. Gertrude is not that which we
should expect to find inserted along with that os S. Etheldreda

swithun, Ethelwold, and Judoc) in the Litany ot' the Visitation Order, and bya prayer
in the Burial Order, intended to be said in the church oi the New Minster (alter the
body has been carried to the neighbouring churches, and prayers have been said in
them) in which S. Judoc and S. Grimbald are mentioned. .

¹ M. Pottier, in saying that these are the only unusual names in the Canon oi the
lumicges MS„ has perhaps overlooked the lact that in the clause communicantes the
name oi S. George is inserted aster those os SS. Cosmas and Damian, and before those
ol SS. benedict, lllartin and Gregory. A possible account os this matter is that the
text, in one of the MSS. in the pedigree os the Jumiiges book, ran “Cosmae et
Damiani, Gregorii, Benedicti, Martini,” thatin an intermediate MS. “ Gregorii '' has,
by aclen'cal error, been converted into “Georgii,’' and that the consequent omission
ol S. Gregory’s name has been amended by its addition after that ol S. lllartin, leaving
the clerioal error as au integral partos the text. The mention ol S. Georgeis certainly
unusual, but in any case it can hardly throw light on the provenancc ol the MS. ,
