INTRODUCTIOM lxiii

agree with those· sor the Vigil os SS. Simon and Jude‚ and'the
Festival os SS. Philip and james.l The mass Iu Nar. Euange-
listarum appears in Leos. (C), those Iu Nat. Unius Martyris,
Iu Nat. Plur. Martyrum and Iu Nat. Plur. Confessorum all
appear in the Commune os (Mur), the two former also in
Leol . (A).² That Iu Vig. Unius Confessoris nearly agrees with
the mass lor the feast os a Confessor in (Mur.) :³ that lor the
vigil of several Confessors agrees with the massin Men. ln
several of the masses ol the Commune it is possible to trace
resemblanees to the Gelasian books: some appear there in
almost the same form, though two ol these are in the Proprium,
not in the Commune of the Gelasian books⁴ The mass for the ¹
festival of the Dedication ol a church agrees closely with that
in Men, the Collect, Secret and Postcommunion are found in
Leofr. C and also (with the Super Populum) in (Mur). The
mass sor the anniversary ol Ordination agrees, so sar as the
Collect, Secret‚ and Posteommunion are concerned, with a Missa
proprio Poutrfierlr iu Orde‘uate'oue ipsius which forms partos the
contents ol Leofr. C.
It has seemed worth while to discuss the eontents of the
Τ emporale and Sanctorale ol the Jumieges manuscript in some
detail, for two reasons In the first place, such an examination
gives ground sor the belief that we have¹ in this manuscript, as
in the texts of Leofr. A and of Menard's Sacramentum, an
example os the manner in which, in the tenth and eleventh
centurieS, the contents of the Roman Sacramentary represented
by Mur. were combined with the contents ol Alcuin’s supple·
ment, and with matter taken from the older mass-books of the
Gelasian type. ln Menard’s Sacramentary the Gelasian books
appear to have been more freely employed than in Leofr. A,
¹ The second oi these is also used in the Commune os (Mur.) and Leofr. (A).
² These messes agree with those os S. Mennas, SS. Felicissimus and Agapirus,
aud SS0 Processus and Martinianus, in the Proprium.

³ Compare the mass ior the feast of S. silvester in the Proprium.

⁴ The mass In Vig. Plur. Martyrum corresponds closely to the Gelasian mass ior
the Vigil ol SS. John and Paul 3 that lu Natali Unius confessoris to a mass in the
Commune ol R and S: thar ln Vrg. (letius Wrgr'ur's resembles the Gelasian mass
for the Vigil oi S. Caecilia; the first mass In Nat. Unius Virginis is in close agree-
ment with S.
