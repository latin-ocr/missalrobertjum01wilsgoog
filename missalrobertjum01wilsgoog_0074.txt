lxxiv NOTE.

third is the Preface for the feast of SS. Timotheus and Symphorianus, which
does not agree with the Preface of either of the two masses for the day in

the Jumihges MS„ but follows emutatis mutandis the Preface for S. Hennes
in the Jumieges hook. The mass of S. Hermes in the Havre Ms. has no
Preface. similarly the Preface for the feast of S. Agapitus (xv. Kal.
Sept.) in the Jumieges MS. is transferred with a change of name to
the mass for the feast of S. Magnus (xiv. Kal. Sept.) in the Havre MS„

' which has no Preface in the mass of S. Agapitus

The Prefaces of the Commune Sanctorum in the Havre book differ from
those of the Jumieges book in the majority of cases. The series of votive
masses were apparently assigned to the same days of the week in the two
books.¹ That in the Havre MS. is imperfect, and it is not impossible that it
included a mass in memoriam Salvatom’s like that on p. 241 infra But if
it contained such a mass it must have been placed differently from that in
the Jumieges book. One of the five Prefaces of these votive messes which
remain in the Havre MS. differs from that of the corresponding mass in the
Jumieges boolc

¹ The mass ad suffragia angelomaem is placed in the flavre MS. before that pm
peccatoribus [P peccafisk but the headings given by M. Fierville show that the first of
the two was assigned to Tuesday, the second to Monday.
