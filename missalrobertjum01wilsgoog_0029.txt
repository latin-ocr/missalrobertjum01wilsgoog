force as an indication of date, is the omission of the name of
S. Alphege. He had been Bishop of Winchester before he
became Archbishop‚ and we might therefore expect to find him
commemorated at Winchester earlier than in most localities.
His sanctity seems to have been recognised within avery few
years from his death in 1012, while his remains still lay in
London: and after his translation in 1023 some mention of his
name might be conlidently expected in any Kalendar belonging
to the south of England, and not least ina Winchester manu-
script.

Thus from the evidence of the Kalendar and the Propn'um
it seems most likely that the manuscript was written after the
year 1008 ; it seems probable that it was written before the end
of 1023. The suggestion of a date between 1013 and 1017 has
less sure ground. 1t depends, for the later limit, on the
inference from the absence of any mention of the obits of
Ethelred and Edmund ‘⁴ lronside '' z for its earlier limit, on the
fact that the mention of S. Florentinus, in the Litany pro
infirmit, is most easily accounted for if we regard the manu-
script as having been written in or after the year 1013. This
point will be discussed further in considering the evidence as to
locality,1 which is the next subject of our enquiry.

For determining the place at which the manuscript was
written we find in the book itself evidence of two kinds. The
illuminations with which it is adorned are of a peculiar type,
which is found in a small number of English manuscripts and
is believed to mark the work of what is called the Winchester
school. It would be possible, on the evidence of the illumina-
tions alone, to assign the, manuscript with some confidence to
one of the two great monasteries of Winchestcr, and to decide

Kalendar-Ethelred on S. George’s day, Edmund on S. Andrew's day, in 1016.
There is, however, in each ease sufficient space for a note of the obit, if the scribe
had chosen to add such a note in the Kalendar.
