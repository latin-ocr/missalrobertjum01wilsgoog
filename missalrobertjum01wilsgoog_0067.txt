are all in Muratori's §aeramentary So also is the Benedictio
vestium. The form for the Benedictio Virginis differs from that
in Muratori’s Sacramentary, which has not the mass following,
nor the Benedictio Vcduae, nor the mass connected with it. The
Leofric Missal contains the whole of this Section, except the two
masses, with slight variations and some additions¹ The prayer
od Mandatum which forms the fifth section, is in the Leofric
Missal, but not in Muratori's text. The Benedictio solis et oquae
is found both in Muratori and in the Leofric Missal with the
omission of one prayer²: but the Leofric Missal has not any, and
Muratori’s text has not all of the prayers for use in the various
parts of the monastery.³ Several of the benedictions which
make up the rest of this section of the Jumieges boolr are found
both in Muratori’s Sacramentary, and in the Leofric Missal.
The Benedictio lactis et ettellis is in the Leofric Missal, but
notin Muratori's text.⁴ The second Benedictio partis is not in
the Leofric Missal. The Benedictio incensi is not in Muratori's
text, nor does it appear in the earliest part of the Leofric Missal ;
but it is found among the additions of· Leofric C. Neither
Muratori's text nor the Leofric Missal contains the Benedictio
arborum, Benedictio pomorum, Benedictio putei, or Benedictio
sentinis³

The section which follows, containing the order for admitting
a novice to monastic profession, is not parallel to anything
contained in the other books with which we have been compar-

many details from the parallel forms in some later English
books To examine it closely would be beyond the scope of
