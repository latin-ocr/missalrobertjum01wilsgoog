real test of locality, we shall find that, with'very few exceptions,
the names of saints supplied by the Kalendar and the Proprium

Sanctorum of our MS. may be divided into two groups One of
these consists of names belonging to England, the other of
names connected with adistrict including the north of France,
the March of F landers, and part of Lower Lotharingia Within
each of these groups, again, we may find evidence of a more
precise kind, in the prominence given to certain narnes, either by
the ornamentation given to them in the Kalendar, or by the
presence of proper masses in the text. We may first take the
saints of the English group, rnarlring with an asterisl( those
festivals which appear in the Kalendar, and withan “obelus ’'
those for which the book provides special masses. The few titles
printed in italic type indicate that the masses are to be found,

not in the body of the book, but in the leaves at the beginning
of the volurne.
