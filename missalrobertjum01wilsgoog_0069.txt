The Orationes in Agenda Mortuerum and the order olthe
Burial of the Dead differ from the parallel sectioh os the Leofric'
Missal‚ though both contain, as might be expected, a consider-
able proportion of common material. In this section of the
Jnmiege's manuscript there are a good many forms which occur'in
one orother os the Gelasian Sacramentaries V and R, and the ’
samemay be said os the series os masses sor the departed some
of which differ from those os the Gelasian V only in the absence
os a second Collect‚'an'd a special Hanctgritur, and in the presence
os a proper Preface. There are, naturally some resemblances
also to the series os masses in the Leolric Missal and of
Muratori's Sacramentary, but the series as a whole does not·
agree with either os these.

Os the five masses pro vivis atque defunctis four occur in the
Leofric Missal, the first three in the original part of the Sacra· ’
mentary (the second being twice repeated, with some variations‚
among the additions) ; the fourth, with a Presace not contained
in the Jumieges book, is also among the contents oi Leof . C.

The mass pro sacerdotibus with which the Sacramentary ends
is not found as a whole in the Leosric Missal; but the prayer
which serves as its 'collect occurs, with some variation, among
other additions os the later hands in that manuscript.¹ This
mass furnishes the only instance in the Jumieges book os the
Epistle and Gospel being written out at length. In some other
rnasses in the latter part of the book they are indicated< by
their first words ; but even this is rare.

The inscription on the last leaf of the manuscript is repro-
duced in Plate XV. It will seen that its first paragraph, so far
as appears from its wording‚ seems to have been written by
Robert oi Jumieges himself, while still Bishop oi London. The
second portion is also worded in the first person: and it may
perhaps be thought that the apparent'difference in the hand·
writing ⁴of the two parts, noticed elsewhere,2 is sufficiently
accounted for by the supposition that the last lines were added‚'
