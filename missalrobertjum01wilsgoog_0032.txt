INYRODUCYION. xxiv

S. Birinus, two of S. Ethelwold. We might e'xpect that some
note of the festivals of S. Swithun would appear in a Winchester
Kalendar, even though'it were not that of the.Old Minster:
and hence the number of these entries, perhaps, is less to be
considered than the relative prominence given to the festivals,
None of them is specially marked by gold letters in the
Kalendar: this distinction, indeed, is given to few of the English
saints ;1 but had the book been written in S. Swithun's‘Minster
he would surely have received from the scribe some share of
such honour. As it is, there is nothing in the Kalendar to
indicate that any one of the three festivals of S. Swithun was of
high rank, while only one of them has a proper mass in the
sanctorale. The case is' the same with' the two festivals of
S. Birinus. Thus, taking the Kalendar and the Proprium
together, we find that the promincnce given to these two saints,
especially venerated in the Old Minster, is less than we might
look for in a manuscript written in that house. They are indeed
distinguished, but not more than we might naturally expect in a
book written in any of the monasteries in Winchester. On the
other hand we find that the Proprium provides a proper mass
for each of the two festivals of S. Ethelwold, to whom the'monks
of the New Minster owed an especial reverence: while we find
also in the Kalendar, though not in the Proprritm, 'the mention
'of S. Grimbald, the original abbot of New Minster.² ἕ ’
With regard to the promincnce given to the saints of Ely, it
may be said that it is less than we should expect if the book had,
as M. Pottier supposes, been written for use in that monastery.
Several of them appear in the Kalendar, and one festival of

¹ S. Edward, S. Augustine, S. Cuthbert are entered in gold uncials, S. Etheldreda
(June 23) and S. Ethelwold (Aug. 1) in gold rustic capitals, S. Tibba in gcld
minuscules The last distinction is probably due to the fact that the entry follows
closely on the Christmas groap of festivals, and S'. Ethelwold appears in the same line
and script as S. Peterad Vincula. '
Ι ².After,the removalof New Minster to Hyde in 1110, S. Grimbald appears
to have been regarded as one of its principal patrous: but it is quite possible that his
festival was not, even at New Minster, of much importance at the time when the
tls. was written. Another local festival is perhaps indicated by the entry, on
Apr. 1, of the name of Borontus or Borontius: but 1 have failed to find any evidence
as to this saint orto discover his name in any other Kalendar. He was perhaps a
local “ wortby'’ rather than a saint.
