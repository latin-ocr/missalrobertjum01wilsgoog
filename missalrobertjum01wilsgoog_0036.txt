abbess oi Dereham, notos Ely.¹ Her connection with Ely was
apparently due to the translation os her relics to that house in
974, aster the destruction ol Dereham by the Danes. lt is
perhaps only natural that in the Litany os any Benedictine
’ house in southern England some representatives of Ely should
find mention: and it is also natural that the mention of any one
of a group of saints so closely connected as these four should
bring with it the names os the others. At New Minster, as we
have seen, there were perhaps special reasons sor the veneration
os saints connected with Ely: and the presence os these four
names therefore seems hardly sufficient to support Μ. Pottier’s
theory. Indeed, there are some other names in the Litany os
the manuscript the presence of which seems more in need of
explanation. S. Eormenhild’s name is followed by that os S.
Petronilla, and hers again by those of three other English
saints, S. Cyneswith‚ S. Cyncburga and S. Timba.² These
saints, like those os the former group were connected together
by ties oi kindred: and just as the former group of names has
been used as evidence of a connection between the manuscript
and the monastery oi Ely, so this group might be used as
evidence connecting it with the monastery of Peterborough.
Such a conjecture may be supported also by the distinction
given in the Kalendar to the name os S. Tibba‚⁸ and by the lact
that the Litany includes, in the list of martyra the name os S.
Florentinus, who is probably to be identified with the S. Floren-
tinus or Florentius whose relies were venerated *at Peterborough.
The Anglo·Saxon Chronicle (according to the text of the
Bodleian MS. Laud 636) records the translation to Peterborough,
on one and the same day, ol the relics oi S. Cyneswith, S.
Cyncburga, and S. Tibba The same text also records the
translation to Peterborough, in 1013, os the relics of S. Floren-
tinus, by the abbot Aelfsi, who had purchased them from the

¹ Μ. Pottier has apparently identified her with her kinswoman S. werburga, who
was the fourth abbess ol Ely.

¹ S Timba (or Tibba) is the only one of these three whose name appears in the
Kalendar oi the MS.
