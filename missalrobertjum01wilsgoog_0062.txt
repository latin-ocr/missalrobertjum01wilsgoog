of S. Kenelm occurs in a tenth century English Sacramentary,
now at Orleans, which M. Delisie believes to proceed from
Winchcombe.1 The mass of S. Genovefa seems to be for the
most part taken from one included in the Commune Sanctorum
of Gem.; that of S. Justus from the mass of S. Vitus; while the
mass for the Translation of S. Martin has supplied the Preface
for the Translation of S. Ethelwold. We have already seen
that the masses of S. Vedast‚ S. Omer, and S. Augustineof
Canterbury are in close agreement; they have probably found
their way into the textos Gem. from different sources, having
themselves a common source. Some of the masses of English
Saints are marked by features of style which suggest that, if not
the work of a single hand, they are at any rate th'c product of a
single school. The use of rather unusual words, and a certain
turgidity of expression, which are perhaps most distinctly to
be seen in the mass of S. Etheldreda, may be found also in
the masses of S. Eormenhild, S. Ethelwold (Kal. Aug), the
Translation of S. Swithun, and in the Prefaces of S. Oswald
and S. Botulf. It must be admitted that as a whole the masses
of English origin do not compare favourably with the more
restrained and stately forms derived from the older Sacra·
mentaries.

The Commune Sanctorum of Gem. is rather fuller than
that of Lcofr. A, and still more so than that of (Mur), which
provides no masses for vigils, Men. provides a smaller number
of masses than Gem., but has attached to each mass a number ’
of alternative prayers. Gem. employs in the Common of
Apostles masses nearly agreeing with some assigned to
particular days in the Proprium. That for the Vigil of one
Apostle corresponds to the mass for the Vigil of S. Andrew,²
that for the Festival to the mass for S. Andrew’s Day.³ The
masses for the Vigil and Festival of several Apostles similarly

, lanfr. C for the Invention of S. Stephen, but neither agrees with the mass in Gem.

espasge Preface agrees with that for S. Thomas
