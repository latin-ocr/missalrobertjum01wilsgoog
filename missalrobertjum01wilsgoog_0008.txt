PREFACE.

THE issue oi this volume to the members oi the Henry
Bradshaw Society brings toan end a work which has long
been in progress‚ and which had been shared by various hands
before it was committed to my own. The early history oi the
book is as follows The task of transcribing the Missal oi
⁴ Robert os Jumieges was begun about thirty years ago by the
Rev. Francis Procter, now Vice-President os the Society. Mr.
Procter, however, did not complete the work, and his unfinished
copy was given, some years later, to the Rev. S. S. Lewis, with
aview to its completion and publication. The task of tran·

scription was resumed, on Mr. Lewis’ behalf, by a copyist
working under the guidance of the late Abbe Sauvage. The
work was still unfinished at the time oi Mr. Lewis’ decease,

when the transcript was committed to the Council of the Henry
Bradshaw Society, and the task os editing entrusted by the
Council to myself.

My own share in the work has been the revision of the copy
made by Mr. Procter and by the copyist employed sor Mr.
Lewis‚ the transcription oi some portions which still remained
uncopied, the preparation of the Introduction and Indices, and
the task oi seeing the book through the press. For assistance
in this work l have to express my gratitude in the first place to
the authorities os the Library of Rouen, who allowed the Missal
to be deposited for my use at the Bodleian Library sor such time
as was needed sor the completion and revision of the transcript.
But my thanks are due also to others who have in various ways
