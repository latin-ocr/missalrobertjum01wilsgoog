A few of these festivals are recognised in Ott, which provides
Prefaces for S. Projectus, S. Euphemia, S. Rufus, S. Augustine
of Hippo; the mass for the invention of S. Stephen is added
in the margin of Ott. by a later hand.³ The Preface which
appears in otu for S. Prisca on Kal. Sept. agrees with that of
S. Priscus in Gem. on the same day.

The influente of the Gelasian books, or books akin to thern,
will again besech in this group of masses; it extends to a large
proportion of the festivals of saints of early date. The mass of
S. Leodegarius does not appear as a whole in R, which has only
the two Collects. lt is made up from a Gallican mass, the
Post nomina taking the place of the Secret, and the Ad pacem
that of the Postcommunion. The whole of the mass in Gem. is
to be found in the Missale (indicum.⁴

Some orasses, agreeing more or less with those of Gem.,
are supplied for festivals of this group in Leofr. (2- These are
for S. Cuthbert, the Translation of S. Martin, S. Augustine
(of Hippo),the Octave of S, Andrew,and S. Alban.³ The mass

¹ Leofr. has a completely different mass for this day.

² The mass for this day in Leofr. (A) is quite different: Leofr. (C) provides
another, also different.
