monks of Bonneval, in the diocese of Chrntres.¹ For the trans-
lation of S. Cyneswith and her companions no date is given,
but it seems most likely that this event took place within a few
years of the translation of S. Florentium! Thus all these

saints had been, so to say, brought into prominence within a
very short time before the date which has been assigned as the

latest probable date of the Jumieges MS. Their translations
may very possibly 'have given a temporary impulse to their
cultus in other Benedictine communities, as well as at Peter·
horough itself ; and it may be that this is the cause of the
appearance of their names in the Litany. But if the presence
of their names be taken in connection with the absence of the
names of saints locally venerated at Winchester, it must be
allowed that there is good reason for suspecting that, as regards
this portion of its contents, the Jumieges MS.‚ although written
at Winchester, has followed a text used at Peterborough.⁸

¹ S. Florentinus is supposed to have suffered martyrdom near Autun, but the place
of his death bas been disputed. So bas also the place where his relies were really
deposited. But the monastery of Bonneval appears to have claimed them, and to have
recognised him as its patron. According to the Angit-Soron Chroniclc, the monks,
while selling the body of the saint for five hundred pounds, retained possession of his
head. A.-S. Chronicle, ed. Thorpe (Rolls Series) vol. i. pp. 272-3‚ or vol. ii. p 96.

’The translation is recorded in the Angla-Sam Chronr'rlc under the year 963.
But it is quite clear that the writer is speaking of things which happened after that
date, anticipating the history of the abbots of Peterborough; and he ascribes the
translation to Aelfsi, who became abbot in 1006. It is not unlikely that it took place
after the destruction by the Danes, in or about 1010, of the monastery ol Castor,
where SS. Cyneswith and Cyneburga were originally buried.

⁸ 'l'his suspicion is strengthened by a comparison of the last leaves of the Jumieges
MS. (from fol. 207 onwards) with the contents of the corresponding portion of
the fragment of a Winchester Sacramentary found by the Rev. F. E. Warren
in the Chapter Library at Worcester Cathedral, and described by him in the Acadenry
of Dec. 12, 1885. This fragment, which is of a date but little later than that
assigned to the Jumieges MS.‚ no doubt proceeds from Winchester, and there seems
no reason to question the correctness of Mr. Warren’s view that it was intended
for use in the New Minster. It contains (a) part of a series of votive masses ; (b) a
mass pro infirmo followed by an Order for the Visitation and Unction of the sick;
(cl Agenda mortuorum and a series of massespro defunctis. With two exceptions, the
votive masses included in (a) appear also (though not in the same order) in the series
of Votive Masses which in the Jumieges MS. end on 101206. But the Orders for
Visitation, Unction, and Burial, though of course containing many things in common
with the parallel sections of the Jumieges MS.‚ differ from these in arrangement, and
are apparently not derived from the same source as the offices in the Jumieges MS.
The same may be said of the masses pro defunctis. The locality of the offices in the
Worcester MS. is clearly marked by the mention of four Winchester Saints (Birinus,
