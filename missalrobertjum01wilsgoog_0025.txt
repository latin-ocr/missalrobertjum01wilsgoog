In the Kalendar, the festivals os the highest rank are
apparently distinguished by gold uncial characters a second
class being marked by gold rustic capitals, while a small
number of festivals are marked in gold minuscule. This last
class, with two exceptions, consists of festivals which fall on
the same day with one of the first or of the second class.²
In the present volume the gold uncials of the Kalendar are
represented by larger, the rustic capitals by smaller, Gothic
type; the gold minuscules by small capital letters. The entries
in italics are those which are written in colour in the Kalendar
of the manuscript, the colours used being blue and two shades
of red.

The festivals marked by gold uncials in the Kalendar very

as of the highest rank the festival of S. Edward, and gives the

² The exceptions are the Translation of S. Andrew, and S. Tibba: the latteris
commemorated within the Oetave of Christmas, but it is to be observed that the
festival of S. Silvester, also within that Oetave, is not so distinguished.

⁸ The messes of S. Edward contained in the text are found in the leaves at the
beginning of the volume, where there is no omamentation: if they had been written
in their place in the Proprium, the discrepancy which appears with regard to them
might not have arisen. The prominence given to the mention of the Resurrection at
vi. Kal. Apr. is probably due, not to the day being observcd as a festival, but to the

scribe’s having regarded this traditional date as more or less representing the moveable
