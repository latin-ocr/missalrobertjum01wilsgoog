that of Menard's Sacramentary by the columns of the Bene·
dictine edition of S. Gregory, aud in that of the Leofric Missal‚
by the pages of Mr. Warren's edition.

With regard to the general arrangement of the text it
may be well to point out that the Jumieges MS. is arranged
on the same lines as the Leofric Missal‚ in which it may be said
that the Temporale and Sanctorale form distinct sections The
Sacramentaries of Muratori and Menard follow another plan,
blending in one series the two divisions of the Proprium,
while Muratori’s Sacramentary differs from all the other three
in the fact that in it the greater part of the Sunday masses,
which formed part of Alcuin's compilation, have not been fused
with the Proprium of the Roman Sacramentary, but appear still
included in the supplement

The text of the Canon contained in the Jumiegcs manuscript
presents few features of special interest, beyond the presence in
it of the names of S. George, S. Etheldreda‚ and S. Gertrude, of
which account has already been taken¹ A clause (Memento
mei) is inserted in the text after the Supplices te rogamus and
before the Memento etimn : and at the end of the Canon, after
the Agreus Dei, some additions have been made by a later hand.
In the Codex Ottobom’onus a clause beginning Memento mei,
similar to, but not exactly agreeing with, that which forms part
of the Canon in Gem., has been added in the margin by a later
hand.

In the contents of the Temporole Gem. and Leofr. are for the
most part in agreement, except for the fact that Leofr. generally
has, while Gem. very frequently has not, an Oratio super populum
as part of its masses. W herc both have a Super Populum it is
often the case that the prayer in one text is not the same as
that in the other. A proper Preface occurs in almost every
mass iu the T corporale of Gem., and these are generally the
