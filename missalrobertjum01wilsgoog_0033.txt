S. Etheldreda is marked there by gold letters and in the
Sanctoralc by a proper mass. But this is perhaps sufficiently
accounted for, if not by the honour in which S. Etheldreda -
was commonly held,¹ by the fact that S. Ethelwold, who may be
called the second founder of the New Minster, was intimately
concerned in the affairs of Ely. There is some reason to think
that a special bond of confratemity existed not only between
New Μ inster and its parent house of Abingdon, but also between
New Minster and Ely.² Of the appearance of S. Etheldreda's
name in the Canon of the Mass, to which M. Pottier calls

attention, it will be more convenient to speak at a later stage.
It has been said that in the later, or local, portion of the

Kalendar and Proprium the most important part of what may
be called the foreign element consists of commemorations of
saints belonging to the countries which lie round the March of
Flanders. This is what we might naturally expect in a
manuscript written in the south of England during the 10th or
early part of the 11th century. The most obvious source for
importations, if one may use the term, was clearly to be found
in these regions, with which there was frequent communication,
and where the language commonly in use differed but little
from the English tongue. Probably many of the festivals of
the saints of this region had found their way into the Kalendars
of English churches before the time when Alfred encouraged or
invited distinguished clerks frorn Flanders and the neighbouring
territories to cross the sea to England and to settle in his
kingdom. But the veneration of the local saints of this foreign
region was no doubt advanced by the influence of these foreign
ecelesiastics: and it may be the case that in the Kalendar and
Proprium of the book we are considering there remain some
traces of the influence of S. Grimbald who was himself of their

number.
