same model, but has a different Super Populum. Gem., on the
other hand discards the mass of the ⁴‘ Vacant '' Sunday, except
the Preface, which it joins with the Secret and Postcommunion
of the 17th of the Sunday masses in (Mun). For the Collect
Gem. has the first, while (Mur.) has the second, of the two
Collects in the corresponding mass of R and S(that for the
zoth Sunday after Pentecost). Thus the Prcface of the
“Vacant'' Sunday is in Gem. united with a set of prayers
different from those with which it appears in Leofr. and Men,
and the same difference os arrangement prevails throughout the
rest of these Sunday masses.¹ Otherwise the general agreement
between (Mur.) Leofr. and Gem. is much the same in the later
as in the earlier masses of the series. But from the 19th Sun-
day onwards the 'masses of Gem. contain no Super Populum,
and are therefore in closer agreement, so far, with those of
(Mun). One point of differente may be noted. The Collect
for the 23rd Sunday after the Octave in Men. agrees with
that for the 25th Sunday after Pentecost in Leofr. and Men.
but differs from that for the 22nd Sunday of the series in
(Mur). The reason appears to be that Leofr. Men. Gem. have
taken the first Collect of the corresponding mass in R and S,
while (Mur.) has adopted the second.2 The second Collect
appears as the Super Populum in Leofr. and Men.

ln Men„ as in the Gelasian books there are five masses for

the Sundays before Christmas. Leofr. and Gem. agree with
Mur. in providing only four. Except in the Super Populum

¹01c which has the Preface for the “vacant” Sunday as that for the 19th
Sunday after Pentecost, discards that which Gem. retains for the next Sunday ; its
Preface for the aoth Sunday “after Pentecost '' agrees with that in Gem. for the aoth
sunday ‘⁴ post Octavar.” But Ott. (sofar as appears from Muratori's extracta) has no
l'reface for the alst Sunday: and the remaining Prefaces are not in the same order
which they follow in Gem. Men. Leofr. lt may be noted that the Prefaces for the
Sundays after Pentecost contained in a rath century Winchester Missal, now in the
Public library at Hane, do not exactly agree with those of Gem. Men. Ott. or Leofr.
They correspond on the whole rather more closely with Leofr. than with Gem. But
the Preface for the 22nd Sunday (in Gem. that for the 21st after the Octave) has in
the Havre MS. the fuller form in which it appears in Gem., not the abbreviated form
found in Leofr. For some further consideration of the Prefaces of this Missal see p.
lxxiii. irpra.

² The text of Pamelius (Litargiceu Lat. ii. 414) agrees with (Mur.) as to the
Collect
