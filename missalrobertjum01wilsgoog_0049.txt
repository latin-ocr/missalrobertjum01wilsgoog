xlviii INTRODUCTION.

Gem. It may be noted that Leofr., like Gem., places before the
mass of Palm Sunday a form for blessing the palms: but the
form does not agree with the fragment os the Bondicteo
Palntarnm which remains in Gem.

In the Good Friday prayers it may be remarked that Gem.
in the prayer “pro christianissimo imperatore‚'' reads “respice
ad Anglornm benignus imperium.'' The form for the Benedictzo
Cerei is that commonly found, agreeing (except for a few slight
variants) with Leofr. and the first of the two forms in (Mun).
The lessons and prayers before the Benedictto Fontis agree with
the order of Mur, not with the fuller order of Leofr. and
(Mur.): but the tracts Cantemus domino and Vinea sacta est,
which Mur. does not mention, are indicated in Gem. The order
of Baptism, which Leofr. separates from the T anteportale, follows
here in Gem., where it is preceded by the forms of benediction
and exorcism of the Cateehumens, and followed by forms for
clinical Baptism and for the reception as a catechumen os a
convert from heathenism. The former of these appears in the
same shape in (Mur.),¹ the latter in the Gelasian Sacramentaries
V and R?

In the mass of Eastcr Day Gern. agrees with Ott. (Mur.)
and differs from Mur. Men. Leofr., in retaining the Gelasian
Preface: it also has the Benedictio Carnis which is absent from
Mur. Men. Leofr. and from V and R, but appears in S. This
form is placed in Gem. after the Postcommunion‚ but retains
the ending per quem leaeo omnia, indicating its original position
at the close of the Canon. Its text is practicallythe sameas
that printed by Gerbert‚³ varying in one or two points from that
of S 2. The messes for the days of the weelr following Easter
are almost identical in Gem. Mur. Men. Leofr., the Prefaces in
Gem. Men. Leofr. agreeing with those in Ott, not with the
series of Eastcr Prefaces in (Mun). Men. and Leofr. show
some divergcnces from the others in the mass of Monday, while
