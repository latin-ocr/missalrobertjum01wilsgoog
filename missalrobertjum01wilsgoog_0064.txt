or in the Jumieges manuscript That is to say, we find substi-
tutions of Gelasian forms for those of the Roman Sacramentary
more frequently in Menard's text than in the other two.
ln Leofr. A and in the Jumieges book, we generally find that,
where a mass is provided either in the Roman Sacramentary
or in Alcuin’s supplement, it is followed, and the differences
are differences of addition. But besides thus supplementing
individual masses, both Leofr. A and the Jumidges manuscript
add, in the Sanctorale, many masses for days not recognised
in Mur. Both seem to draw a large part of their material for
these additions from the later Gelasian Sacramentaries, repre·
sented by S: and the Jumieges manuscript adds in this way and
from this source even more than Leofr. A.

But this result of our examination may be further held to
show something as to the origin of the Jumidges manuscript.
lt was written, evidently, in England, for use in England. But
its ancestry, if one may use the phrase, seems to be traceable
not to the Roman service-books imported to England by
S. Augustine, but to a composite Sacramentary, such as were
’ produced in the dominions of Charles the Great and his
successors, after the adoption of the Roman Sacramentary which
forms the nucleus of the books known as Gregorian. lts close
resemblance to Leofr. A may suggest further that the manu·
script which supplied the main body of its Temporale and
Sanctorale had been written in a region not very far removed
from that which produced the oldest part of the Leofric Missal.
As we have seen,¹ the presence of certain masses in the Proprium
may point to Flanders or its immediate neighbourhood as the
place whence this parent manuscript proceeded: but the evidence
is hardly sufficient to warrant any decided inference. The
introduction into England of a continental service-book and its
local adoption would not have been unlilrely in the ninth or
tenth century: on the hypothesis that the Jumieges manuscript
was written at New Minster, we can point to two dates and
two occasions when such a Sacramentary might have been
