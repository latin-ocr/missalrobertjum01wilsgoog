When all these are thus completed,
let the priests, as many as are there,
say separately these prayers over the
sick man. lf there be then a bishop
there, this is his office.³

¹ Asin the Jumiltges MS.

'³ The two prayers which follow are the same as in the Jumieges MS. After
them in the Cambrai Ordo followsa hymn, and then (with the heading Tunc dr'cat
sacerdos) a benediction, broken into single clauses with Amen after each clause.
The benediction, except for its form, and for some omissions and slight variations
of wmding, agrees with those to be said by the priests or the bishop according to the
rubrio of the Jumieges its.

³This rubrio does not appear in the Cambrai Ordo But a mbric closely
resembling it appears in another Ordo given by hlartene from the Pontifical ol
Salzburg (Ordo xv. of hlart'ene's series), and also in the fragment of the Winchestor
book already referred to. (See p. xxxvi. supra, note 3.) The other rubrica of the
salzburg Ordo and of that of the Worcester MS. show no marked resemblance to those
of the jumieges book. The rubrio in the Worcester lllS., as transcribed by Mr.
Warren, runs thus :-

Hr's expletis sacerdotes dr'caul lras berrcdr'clr'oucs super infirmum, uuusquisque suam.
Sin aufem episcopus adjirerit psius officium lroc erit.
