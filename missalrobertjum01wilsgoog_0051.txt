agree except in the Presace. Leofr. also agrees with Gem.
but adds a Super Populum. The Preiace oi Gem. and Leol .
is also in Men. 3ηά Ott.l For Pentecost and the three days
which follow the prayers oi Gem. arethe same as those os Mur.
Leofr. and Men. (save sor the presence in the last two oi some
additionsl: the Prefaces are the same as in Otr? Men. Leof .
The case is the same with the mass sor the Friday. For the
Thursday, Mur. supplies no mass. Here Gem. employs the
prayers oi the mass which in S. is given as an alternative sor
that ol the Vigil oi Pentecost, 3ηά which is marked by S 2 for
use infra hebdomadam. The Preiace ol Gem. Leofr. Men. is the
same as that of Ott.

The prayers oi the Sabbatum in xii Lectionibus are almost
the same in all the four books. Leofr. omits one oi the prayers
before the Collect oi the mass and Men. has a Secret differing
srom that os thc others. The Presace in Gem. Leofr. Men.
agrees with Ott. For the Sunday following, Gem. Leosr. Men. ⁶
all discard the mass which appears in Mur. The two former
agree in adopting the prayers and Prelace of the Gelasian books,
omitting the first two collects oi the mass as it stands in
V? while Gem. also omits the Super Populum. The Prclace
appears also in Ott 3ηά Men.

The Sunday's which follow are rechoned in Gem. as the first,
second, &c aiter the Octave: Leofr. reckons them as the
second, third, &c aiter Pentecost, and in this reclconing Men.
(which places the corresponding masses apart‚ aster the
Commune Sanctorum) and Ott. agree. ln (Mur.) they arc
counted as the first, second, &c aster Pentecost, the ‘¹ Dominica
vacat '' of Mur. being left out os the reckoning both at thc
beginning and in the middle oi the series. For our present
purpose, it will be unnecessary to reser continually to this
difference: we may consider that the first Sunday aiter
Pentecost in Mur. is the same as the first Sunday after the
Octave in Gem.

² Mur. has only the Preiace ior Pentecost.
