i. F irst may be mentioned the Gregorian Sacramentary

which it was received irom Rome by Charles
the Great in the latter years os the eighth cen·

(b) The second part ol Muratori's text, extending
lrom col. 143 to col. 290, may be regarded as
representing the supplementary matter com·
piled by Alcuin, and added to the Roman
Sacramentary already mentioned, with the

portion of the text will be denoted by the
symbol (Mun).
