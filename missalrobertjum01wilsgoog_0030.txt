that it was written either at the Old Minster, commonly called.
S. Swithun’s‚ or in the New Minster, sometimes called S. Peter's.
The late Professor Westwood,¹ in his account of the book, while
recognising the inferiority of the illuminations to those of the
Benedictional of S. Ethelwold, is yet of opinion that the two
manuscripts proceed from the same place and were executed at
about the same time. He assigns them both to the New
Minster. M. Andre Pottier,l on the other hand, is of opinion
that the study of the Kalendar and Proprium of the manuscript
leads to the conclusion that it was written in the Old Minster of .
Winchester‚ and was intended for use in the monastery of Ely.
For the latter part of this conclusion M. Pottier seems to rely on
the presence of certain names, not in the Kalendar or Sanctorale,
but in the Canon of the Mass and in the Litany pro infirmis.
On these points something will be said hereafter: but with
regard to the place where the manuscript was written, it will
perhaps appear that the evidence of the Kalendar and the
Proprium Sanctorum, while distinctly indicating that the book
isto be connected with Winchester‚ points on the whole to the
New rather than to the Old Minster as the place of its origin.
M. Pottier does not state in detail the grounds which led him to
assign it to S. Swithun’s: but some of them may readily be
conjectured. The most obvious grounds for such a view appear
to be somewhat weakened by considerations which are not,
perhaps, evident at first sight: and there are also some points
which seem to be in favour of a different conclusion, which it is
not unlikely that he left out of account.

If we disregard, as we may for our present purpose, those
commemorations of saints which have a place in a large number
of Westem mass-books before the close of the tenth c'entury,
and were probably found in the great majority of English books
before the date of the Jumieges MS, and also those which
though less widely spread were yet so common as to afford uo
