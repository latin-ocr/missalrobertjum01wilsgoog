INTRODUCYION.

early part of' the tenth century, and was written in
Lotharingia. Thisbe has distinguished as A, while
some additions written in England at different dates
he has distinguished as C. To avoid confusion, it will
be best to follow his notation, at least so far as to
distinguish the later English additions as Leofr. C..
employing as a rule for the earliest portion of the book
the symbol Leofr.

iii. The Sacramentary edited by Menard, ancl reprinted
in the Benedictine edition of S. Gregory's works.
This text (based on a ninth or tenth century MS.) will
be denoted by the symbol Men.

ivt The Jumieges MS. itself will frequently be denoted by
the symbol Gem.

Besides these texts, which all represent one type or another
of the Gregorian Sacramentary, it will sometimes be necessary
to refer to the Sacramentaries of the Gelasian class. First and
most important of these is the book commonly known as the
Gelasian Sacramentary, now in the Vatican Library: but the
resemblances which we may have occasion to notice are more
commonly to be found in the later Gelasian Sacramentaries of
S. Gallen and Rheinau, used by Gerbert for his Monumenta
Veteris Lr'turgr'ae alemannicae. For these books it may be best
to employ again the symbols by which they are denoted in the
recent edition of the §elasian Sacramentary, and to distinguish
them by the letters V (Vatican MS.) R (Rheinau MS.) and
S (S. Gallen MS.) further distinguishing, when necessary, the

original text of S as S1 and the text produced by a ninth-
century corrcction as 52. But the consideration of particular
readings will not be so minute as to require any large employ· ·
ment of the last distinction.

Where a reference is given to the printed texts, it will
be given, in the case of Muratori's Sacramentary, and of the
Vatican text of the Gelasian Sacramentary, by the columns of
Muratori's Liturgr'a Romana Verus in the edition of 1748,l in

'These are marked iu the margins of the Oxford edition of the Gelasian
Sacramentary.
