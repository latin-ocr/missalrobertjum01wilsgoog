Making this allowance, it will be found that the first sixteen
masses of Gem. agree in the Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion
with the first sixteen of (Mun), the Presaces agreeing with
those of Ott. The same amount of agreement may be observed
in Leofr. while Men. is generally in agreement, though it shows
some variations from (Mur.) and Ott. even where Leofr. and
Gem. agree. But Leofr. Men. Gem. all have, in these masses, a
Super Populum while they do not always agree in their selection.
ln Leofr. the prayer employed for this purpose is most osten
one of the Collects in the corresponding mass os the later
Gelasian books. Gem. on the other hand sometimes seems to
draw upon a Gelasian collection of Benedictroms Super Populum
like those which in V and S follow the Canon Actionis,1 and
sometimes employs a form which appears among the series of
select collects in (Muta).

The 17th of the Sunday masses in Gem. Leofr. corresponds
” not with the 17th of the series in (Mur.) but with the mass for
the Sunday preceding the Ember Days of September, con-
tained in Mur. The Presace agrees with that in Ott. where the
Presaces for the Ember Days follow closely. The Super
Populum in Leofr. does not agree with that of Gem., the former
having the second Collect of the mass in R and S, the latter
one os the series in the Gelasian books The masses for the fol·
lowing weeledayS, and the prayers of the Sabbatum in xii
Lectionibus are the same in Gem. and Leofr., except that Gem.
has a Super Populum in each mass: the Collects, Secrets, and
Postcommunions agree with Mur, the Presaces with Ott.

The mass for the next Sunday in Leofr. has the Collect
'assigned in Mur. to the “Domiuica uacat,'' following in this
respect, and also in the Secret, Presace and Postcommunion, the
mass for the “Domiue'ca uacat” in R and S, from the second
Collect of which it takes its Super Populurrz.² Men. follows the

¹ The cases in which Gem. employs a form included in the Gelasian series oi
Postcommunions, and not found in (Mur.) are sufficiently numerous to warrant the
supposition that this has been the case. 11 is not unlilcely that the series· of Benc-
dicle'ones in S was at least as full as that in V, and the whole of the collects selected
in Gem. may have been found in the series of some other Gelasian MS.
