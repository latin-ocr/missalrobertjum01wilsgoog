ΙΝ the Public Library of Havre is preserved a portion of a Missal
apparently written about the year 1120 for use at Winchester.¹ The
Presaces of this book have been made known by M. Ch. Fierville‚ ina
paper published by the Sociltl Havrarie fflJi'tudes diverses. They are 190 in
number, 50 belonging to the Temporale, 121 to the Propn'um, 14 to the
Commune sanctourm, and the rest to votive masses.

ln regard to the Temporale it may be noted that the Havre MS. has
only one Rogation·day Pret'aee ; that the Prefaces for the Vigil and the
Festival ot' the Ascension have the same positions as in the Leolric Missal,
so differing from the order os the Jumieges MS. ; and that there is no
proper Prelace for the Sabbatum in sii lectrbm‘bus after Pentecost. The
Sundays alter Pentecost are numbered from the Festival (not, as in the
Jumieges MS.. from the Octave) : but the Presaces for the most part agree
with those sor the corresponding Sundays in the Jumieges boot. That
which the Jumieges MS. assigns to the 25th Sunday after the Octave
appears in the Havre MS. for the Sunday after Pentecost (apparently as an
alternative to the Pret'ace de S. Tn'm'tate): that which the Jumieges book
employa for the 22nd Sunday after the Octave is assigned in the Havre book
to the asth Sunday after Pentecost: the Presaces for the 23rd and 240¹
Sundays atter Pentecost iu the one boolr are the sameas those for the
23rd and atth Sundays after the Octave in the other: and the Havre MS.
has Prefaces for the 26th and 27th Sundays after Pentecost which are not in
the series ol the Jumieges bools

Out os the 121 Prefaces of the Propn'um Sanctomm extracted by
M. Fierville from the Havre MS. 70 have the same position as in the
Jumieges bools3 21 are sor days t'or which the Jumieges book provides no
proper mass ; 13 are sor days for which the Jumieges book has a mass but
provides uo proper Pret'ace'; the remaining 17 differ from the corresponding
Prefaces ot' the Jumieges book

Οἱ these 17 two are the Prefaces t'or the Vigil and Festival of S. Peter,
which have reversed the positions given to them in the Jumieges MS. A

² The pnvenonce os the MS. is sufficiently clear from the number of winchester
Saints commemorated in the Proprium Sanctorum. There are three Prefaces ol
S. Jndoc‚ and one ot' S. Grimbald, a lact which may suggest that the book belonged
to the New Minster, or Hyde. The Kelenderis unfortunately lost.

² This number includes a Prel'aoe assigned in M. Fierville's paper to the least oi
SS. Prooessus and Martinianus (vi. Non. Jul.): but the Prelace appears really to belong
to the feast ol the Translatiou of S. Martio, two days later. uso, the number οῖ
this class should be diminisbed, and that οἱ the next class increased to 18.
