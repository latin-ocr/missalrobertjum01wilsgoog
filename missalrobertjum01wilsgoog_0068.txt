The tader ior the visitation and Unction oi the Sick is
pressans! by a mass pro infimis, agreeing in its prayers and
prosam: with one contained in the leofric blissal.1 The order
oi Visitation and Unction is marked by the occurrence (peculiar
to this wsction oi the manuscript) of vemacular rubrics.¹ Their
presence might suggest that the office in which they appear is
the most distinctly English part oi the contents of the book:
ariel it is therefore worth while to observe that the rubrics, which
present one or two rather unusual features, are in very close
agreement with the Latin rubrics osan Ordo printed by Martiae
froin a manuscript Pontifical, belonging to the Church oi Cam-
bari, assigned by him to a date about the end oi the 12th cen·
huy! With this Ordo, moreover, the office oi the Jumieges book
shows an amount of agreement which seems to suggest a close
relationship between the two, though the Ordo given by Martiae
‹nirits some of the prayers contained in the Jumieges manuscript*
'l'lne Litany included in this office has already been mentioned.⁸
'l'lin office is followed by another mass pro sipiano, not contained
in Muratori’s text, or in the Leosric Missal, and by a series os
additional prayers which appears in the former, and oi which
tin· component parts occur also in the latter, though in adifferent
nt·ilt·r.‘¹
