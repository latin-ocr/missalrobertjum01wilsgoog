far as possible, the punctuation of the scribe has been followed
throughout, even where it is faulty. In some cases a note of
interrogation is used: but the instances of this are very rare.

The manuscript is not dated, but the evidence afforded on
the one hand by the character of the script and the style of the
illuminations‚ and on the other by the contents of the book,
enables us to determine its date within pretty narrow limits.
On palaeographical grounds, it may be assigned to the end of
the tenth or the beginning of the eleventh century: the evidence
of its contents, while agreeing with this estimate, would lead us
to place it in the first quarter of the eleventh century, rather
than in the last years of the tenth. Perhaps we may be
warranted in narrowing the limits still further, in considering
that it may be probably assigned to a date between 1008 and
1025, and in suggesting one between 1013 and 1017.

The Easter Tables which follow the Kalendar begin with
the year 1000. This date is one to which a scribe, writing even
as late as 102 5, would very likely have carried his tables back, if
space permitted : but it is not likely that a scribe writing before
the Easter of 999 would begin his tables with a year still future.
Some points in the contents of the Kalendar and Proprium also
seem to indicate a date later than 1000.

The translation of S. Cuthbert noted in the Kalendar on
Sept. 4 probably marks a date after the wanderings of the
saint’s relies had been brought to a close in 995; but even so
the festival might have been noted in a Benedictine Kalendar in
the south of England¹ before the close of the century. The

that the manuscript proceeds from one of the monasteriesof Winchester. The evidence

for this will be further discussed in the peges which follow.
