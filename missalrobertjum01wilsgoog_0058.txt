lviii INTRODUCTION.

the reverse. For the festival of SS. Fabian and Sebastiam,
where Mur. and Leosr. give the two masses separately‚ Gem.
combines them into one, placing the Collect sor S. Sebastian
after that for S. Fabian, &c., but having only one Presace, that
ior S. Sebastian. The mass for S. Gregory's day in Gem. agrees
with Leosr. in adding a Preiace, but differs srom it and agrees
with Mur. in retaining what is probably the older sorm of the
Secret.l There are also some other minor differences3 but it
may be said generally that in this group oi masses the principal
variatione which Gem. shows from the textos Mur. is to be
found in the addition os Preiaces3 and that in most cases Leosr.
agrees with Gem.

Menard's Sacramentary contains masses sor all the days oi
this group: but its divergences srom Mur. are more consider·
able. It may be observed that Gem. places before the mass ol'
the Purification forms sor the Benedictth Cereorum. These do
not occur in Leofr. in the same position, or indeed at all in the
,earliest part oi the textos the Leofric Missal: but the same
prayers and anthems are provided in that portion ol the text
which Mr. Warren distinguishes as C, that is to say, in the part
nithe Leofric Missal which appears to have been written in
England, during the eleventh century? The loss oi a leaf in
Gem. unfortunately prevents us from knowing whether the agree·
ment extended to the rubrio withgwhich Leolr. C ends the
section.⁸

The third group ol masses may be divided into two sections.
Oi these the first consists os 30 ¹ masseS, in which Gem. agrees
wholly or partly with Leosr. A. They are those for the
following days :-

¹ This is in Mur. and Gem. a prayer ior S. Gregory: n Leoir. it is converted
into a prayer sor benefits by his intercession.

² Leofric Mr'ssal, pp. 203-4.

⁸lt may be noticed that the Bemdictio in Gem. follows immediately after the
collect oi the mass ol S. Brigid: while the Secret and Postcommunion oi that mass
do not now appear. This would seem to suggest the possibility that the candles were
blessed during the mass ol the day preceding the Purifiontion, the Secret and Post·
communion being written at the close of the Benedictio, and having thus disappeared
irom Gem. by the loss ol the leaf. Leolr. A has no mass for S. Bn'gid'sday.
