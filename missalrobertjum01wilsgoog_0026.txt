INTRODUCTION.

while it omits the festival of S. Benedict on v. Id.Jul. altogether,
3ηά marks with rustic capitals the feasts of S. Peter’s Chair,
S. Etheldreda, S. Peter ad Vincula, and S. Ethelwold (Kal.
Aug.) The other festivals for which rustic capitals are
employed are the Octave of the Epiphany‚ SS. Fabian and
Sebastian, S. Agnes, the Conversion of S. Paul, S. Agatha,
S. Mark, the “Maccabees¹’ (with S. Peter ad Vincula and
S. Ethelwold) the Exaltation of thc Cross, S. Jerome, SS.
Dionysius Rusticus 3ηά EleutheriuS, S. Luke, S. Eustachius,
S. Brice, and S. Cecilia.

The style of handwriting exhibited in the manuscript may be
fairly judged from the reduced facsimile which will be found on
plate XIV. This exhibits specimens of the different characters
employed for the headings and for the text of the masses
including the smaller characters used for the introits, graduals
and the like in the few masses where these are given. lt also
furnishes, in the last six lines, a specimen of the handwriting of
the Old English rubrics which appear in one part of the book.
ln printing these rubrics, the expansion of contractioris has been
limited to cases where it appeared desirable for the sake of
clearness‚ and where the form of the word may be considered
certain. The scribe’s usage hasbeen followed in regard to the
two forms of the letters which he employs, and also in regard to
his use of Old English characters in Latin words, it has also
been followed in printing the “ Saxon '’ names of the months in
the Kalendar, where the letters have sometimes the Old English,
sometimes the ordinary, minuscule form. The contractioris in
the manuscript are few in number and of an ordinary character.
The spelling presents no unusual features, but it may be worth

while to mention that ae, q, and e are used interchangeably‚ and
that there are occasional instances of the omission or insertion
of the letter leat the beginning of a word, eg. ac for ltac, liora
for ora, laudique for ubique. The punctuation is marked, as a
rule, only by the simple point, which is sometimes placed above,
sometimes on, the line of the ruling, having (in both positions)

festival «l Baster, and as therefore entitled to the treatment which he might heve given
to Easter itself, ifit bad been entered in the Kalendar.
