same which appear in Leofr. On the other hand Leofr., like
Men, generally provides an Episcopal Benediction, and these
are entirely absent from Gem.¹

ln the Christmas masses, with which the Temporalc begins,
it may be noticed that Gem. (contrary to its general usage)
retains the mention of the Roman churches in the headings oi
the several masses. ln the mass of the Vigil, Gem. agrees with
Leofr. Men. Ott. in providing a Preface, which is not in Mur.
ln the first mass os the festival it agrees with Mur. in respect os
the Preface, while Leofr. Men. Ott have the same Prelace as the
Gelasian books, which Gem. employs sor the third mass, where
Mur. Men. Ott. Leofr. agree in using the same Prelace which
Mur. has sor the first. The series oi lilim Orationes in Gem.
includes two prayers which are absent irom the parallel series
in Mur. Leofr. Men. but appear in the Gelasian books, the first
in V and S as a Collect in the mass of the Vigil, the second in
V R and S among the Alt'ac Orationes.

The massot Gem. sor Jan. 1 (Octavus Domim) is not in Mur.
and differs from that in Leofr. by the addition os a Collect ad
Vesperuuu which is not the same as the Super Populum in Men.;
but except sor the heading oi this prayer, sor the absence oi a
second Collect, and for thc exact form os the Preface, the mass
in Gem. agrees with the Gelasian books. The Presace is nearly
in the form given by S 2, which abridges the older Gelasian
Preface, and agrees with Leosr. and Ott In Men. the Prefacc
is still further abridged.

The masscs sor the two Sundays aster Christmas in Gem.
agree with Leofr. and (Mur.) except that (Mur.) has no Preface,
and neither Leofr. nor (Mur.) has a Super Populum. The Super
Populum sor the first Sunday in Gem. agrees with R and S,
that sor the second Sunday in Gem. is in R and S the second

¹ These Benedictions would naturally be omitted in a manuscript written sor use in
a monastery where they were not employed. ln some ‘⁴ milred ’' abbeys, the abbot
had the privilege os using this lorm oi Benediction ι hut the privilege did not belong to
all “ mitred ” abbots, and its extension to abbots was probably at least unusual at the
date when the Jumieges tls. was written. The use os such Benedictions by Bishops

in England at or beiore the date oi the manuscript is attested by the Benedictionals ol
S. Ethelwold and ol Ethelgar.
