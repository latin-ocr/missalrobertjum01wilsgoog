xxxiv INTRODUCJION.

the Missals of Sarum, York, and Hereiord. But in these books
a phrase in the secret, which was especially appropriate at
Rouen, and less appropriate elsewhere, has been changed. ln
the Jumieges MS. it stands unaltered.¹ The masses of S.
Vedast and S. Omer agree, so iar as the collect, secret and '
postcommunion are concerned,¹ with each other and also with
the mass os S. Augustine ol Canterbury. They differ only in
the substitution os the name os the apostle of one region sor that
ol the apostle of another. There is a slight incongruity in their
use in England ε they belong to Arras and to Therouanne. as the
mass os S. Augustine belongs to England. At what timethey
were imported there is no means os knowing: they may have
been introduced at any time before the manuscript was written:
but it is perhaps natural to think that they are more likely to
have been introduced to an English monastery by one coming
from the district where they had their original and proper
significance than to have been adopted by an English corn·
munity proprio motu, and to see in them a trace os S.
Grimbald’s connection with F landers on the one hand and New

It has been already said that M. Pottier, in support of his
view that the manuscript was intended ior use in the monastery

are those oi SS. Etheldreda, Sexburga, Witburga, and Eormen·

S. Gertrude, in the clause Nobis quoque peccatoribus: and the
lour are invoked among virgin saints, in the Litany.⁸ M. Pottier
speaks os them as the first iour abbesses os Ely: but the case
is not quite as he supposed. S. Witburga (the sister os SS.
Etheldreda and Sexburga and aunt ol S. Eormcnhild) was

¹ At Rouen, S. Ouen would naturally be called patronus noster: at l'ork and
Herelord the words patroni κοπτή are changed to patroni sui (ie, fidelis populi),
while the Sarum Missal substitutes confessoris tui atque pontificis.

³ These three prayers make up the mass ol S. Omer. That of S. Vedast has a
prelace, aad has subjoined to it an oratio ad vesperum, which may be taken to
indicate that the festival was one ol high rank.
