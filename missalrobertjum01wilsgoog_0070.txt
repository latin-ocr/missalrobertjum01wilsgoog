also by Robert himself, some years later, during his sojourn at
Jumieges after his flight from England.

In conclusion, a few words must be said as to the method
which has been followed in reproducing the text of the manu·
script The spelling of the original hasbeen followed in all
cases. Words which the scribe as a general rule abbreviates
have been expanded according to the spelling observed in the
few cases where the same word is written at length.l Thus the
heading of certain collects appears as “Ad Vesperum,” though
this heading is only written in full in one or two instances. The
heading “Infra actionem,’' is abbreviated by the scribe in various
ways, some of which might suggest that the form represented is
‘⁴ ln fractione ”but it appeared on the whole most likely that all
the variations should be regarded as abbreviations or condensa·
tions of the usual form, which has accordingly been followed
throughout The “ obelus ” has been employed to mark faulty
readings, which were either of such a kind as to need noexplana-
tory foot·note, or of such a kind that the true reading could
hardly be decidedly given. The great majority of the words so
marked are the actual reading of the manuscript, noted when
the transcript was being collated with the original: but in some
cases the “ obelus ’⁹ was added while the sheets were passing
through the press; and in these cases the sign can only be
said to mark the fact that the faulty reading stands in the
transcript, and that the editor, in the process of collation, did
not notice a divergence from the original.

¹ ln the Kalendar the abbreviations of the original are as a rule preserved ; and
in the portions of the MS. relating to the Kalendar, words are frequently left iu their
abbreviated form, either for reasons of space, or because it appeared quite uncertain
what termination the scribe would haue given to them.
