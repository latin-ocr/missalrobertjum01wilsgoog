if the purpose of the mention of the English saint had been to
adapt the Canon for the use of Ely. A more probable view of
the matter appears to be that the presence of S. Gertrude’s
name is due to the influence of a foreign sacramentary‚ and that
the presence of S. Etheldreda’s name is due to a desire, dictated ,
by English sentiment, to balance the mention oi a foreign saint
by the mention of an English one.¹ If the mention ol S.
Gertrude were due to local veneration of the saint either in the
place where the book was written or in that for which it was
intended, we should expect to find her commemorated also in
the Kalendar or in the Proprium: and S, Gertrude’s name is
not in either of these parts of the Jumieges MS. But the
personal influence of the first abbot, or the intluence of a text
of the Canon introduced by him, or by some one else, at an
early period of the history of a monastery, might well account
for the mention oi a foreign saint in the Canon as used in an
English house: and it is by no means unlikely that S. Grim-
bald, coming as he did from Flanders, where S. Gertrude was
perhaps the principal local virgin saint, brought with him to
New hfinster a text of the Canon which contained her name.
Whother such a text was followed in the mass-books of New
hlinster asa rule‚ or whether her name appeared at all commonly
in lrnnks written in that house, we have no means of judging. But
it is extremely probable that is the text ot New Minster regularly
contained her name, the name of an English saint would be
joined with it: and the name os S. Etheldreda was perhaps the
tuost likely English name to be chosen for such a purpose.

tlne inore point which might seem to furnish evidence oi
lornlity perhaps calls for a word of notice. ln the series ol
