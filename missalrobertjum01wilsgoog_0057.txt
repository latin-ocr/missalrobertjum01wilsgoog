In these masses Gem. differs from Mur. in most cases by the
insertion of aproper Preface, and the majority of the Prefaces
which it inserts are found also in Leosr. and Ott. Leofr. has no
Preface for the second festival of S. Agnes, for the Octave of
SS. Petcr and Paul, or for the festivals of S. Nicomede,
SS. Abdon and Sennen,² S. Eusebius, S. Agapitus, S. Timotheus,
S. Sabina, SS. Cornelius and Cyprian, and S. Saturninus. Ort.
agrees with Gem. in the Prefaces for SS. Abdon 3ηά Sennen,
S. Eusebius, SS. Cornelius and Cyprian, but agrees with Leolr.
in the other omissions, also omitting a few Prefaces which
appear in Leofr. In some cases where all three have a Prcface
they differ in the selection : thus Gem. and Ott. agree, as against
Leofr, in the Prefaces for the feasts of the Exaltation of the
Cross, SS. Peter and Paul, and 5. Andrew. Gem. stands alone
in its Prelaces for the Purification 3ηά for S. Felix.³

With regard to the prayers of these masses Gem. Leofr. and
Mur. are for the most part in agreement, but Gem. sometimes
omits the prayers which in Mur. and Leofr. are appended to the
mass, or converts a Super Populum into an Ad Vesperum, or

¹ The first of these only differs from Mur. Leofr. in having the Secret which these
boolrs assigu to the second.

² The Preface for SS. Abdon aud Sennen issupplied in Leofr. by au rrth century
rnna. seemsruMusal, p. 205.

³ It is worth noting that although S. Felix is referred to as a Confessor both in
the heading of the mass and in the Secret the Preface is one for the festival of a

martyr.
