certainly shows the book to be later than 988, the year ol the
saint's decease. It nray point to a date alter 1033, the year in
which the observance ol the festival is said to have been enjoined
by the law os Canute.¹ But it is most likely that the saint was
commemorated, especially in monastic churches, within a very
lew years srorn the time ol his death. Again‚ the presence in
the Proprium (or rather in the additions to the Proprium con-
tained in the leaves which precede the Kalendar) os two masses
oi S. Edward‚ and the importance given in the Kalendar to the
festival ol his martyrdom,g probably indicate a date later than
1008, in which year the “Witan ” decreed the observancc os his
festival on March 18 throughout England.³

On the other hand it is to be noted that neither the Proprium
nor the Kalendar contains any mention oi S. Alphege, and that
while the dates ol the deaths oi King Edgar and his son S.
Edward are marked in the Kalendar‚⁴ there is no note of the
obit ol Ethelred or ol Edmund ·‘ lronside.'’ It is oi course true
that there was a special reason sor the mention ol S. Edrvard:
and it may be said also that while the memory oi Edgar would
be honoured in the monasteries os Winchester, os which he was
a benefactor, there was possibly no great desire to keep alive
the memory os Ethelred, and Edmund “lronside’' was not
acknowledgcd as King in Wessex. Yet the absence os any note
ol events which might be taken to mark not only the sailure of
one line of Kings, but also the successive stages os Canute's
power, is perhaps significant³ More notable, and oi more

The date ol' 1033 is that assigned by Wilkins, Concilio Magnae Britanniae et
Hiberniae, vol. i. p. 299. The festival is not marked in the Kalendas ol the
Jumieges MS.

² The day is marked in the Kalendar by gold uncial letters, an ornament which,
so lar as a distinction can he drawn, probably indicates that the festival was regarded
as one ot' high rank. ¹ Even allowing lor the honour which might be given to a royal
saint, this would hardly have been the case while the veneratior oi the saint was still,
so to say, tentative and local.
