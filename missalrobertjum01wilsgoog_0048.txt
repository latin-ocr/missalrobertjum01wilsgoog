prayers and with ott„ in the Preface. Leofr. omits two of the
collects which in Gem. and Mur. precede the collect ad Missam,
and has for the Preface that which Gem. Men. Ott assign to
the Saturday following.

'throughout the second week of Lent the prayers of Gem.
are the same as those of Mur, the Prefaces agreeing with those
of Ott Leofr. differs only in providing a Super Populum for
the Sunday‚ and in employing for the Saturday the Preface
which Gem. Men. Ott. assign to the Sabbatum iu xii Lectionibus.
ln the third week Gem. is in the same agreement with Mur. and
Ott.; Leofr. again has a Super Populum for the Sunday‚ but
otherwise agrees with Gem. in all the masses sor the week
except that of the Thursday. Here the mass of Mur. and Gem.
is the Gelasian mass for the feast of SS. Cosmas and Damian‚¹
with the addition² of a Preface and Super Populum. Leofr. has
rejected the Collect, Secret and Postcommunion‚ which contain
references to the martyrs, substituting for them other prayers
found elsewhere in Mur. In Men. the Preface is the same as in
the other Gregorian books, but the Collect, Secret and Post-
communion are apparently drawn frorn the mass sor the
Thursday in the later Gelasian books? where the ‘⁸ Station ” is
as in the Gregorian books, but the prayers have no reference to
the saints.

ln the fourth week Leofr. and Gem. agree with Mur. in the
prayers of the masses, and with Ott. in the Prefaces‚ with the
single exception that in Gem. the Collect for the Thursday
differs from that in Mur. and Leofr., agreeing with the first
Collect for the same day in R and S. The same agreement is
found throughout the rest of the Lent masses until Coena
Domini, save for the presence in each of the Sunday masses of
Leofr. of a Super Populum, which does not appear in those of
Mur. and Gem. For Thursday iu Coena Domini Leofr. and
Ott. supply two Prefaces, of which only the second appears in

¹ The “ Station'’ for the day is “ ad SS. eosrnam et Damianum.”

³ The mess for the festival in V has no Preface: that in S bus a different Preface
from* tint employed here by Gem. and Ott. There is no mess for the festival in R.

⁸ The Collect of Men. is the Super Populum of the mass in R and ὃς the
secret und Poslcommunion retain their places.
