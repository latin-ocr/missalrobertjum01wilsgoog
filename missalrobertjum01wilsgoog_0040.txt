INTRODUCTION. · xxxix ,

intended for use at the entrance to the church, which speaks of
· the place as having been hallowed in honour of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, S. Peter, S. Paul and S. Andrew. If we are to
understand this as a reference to the dedication-title of the
church where the prayer was to be used, it would appear to
contradict the theory that the book was intended for the service
of the monastery of Ely. But the phrase has most likely no
such exact reference. lt is probably parallel to the mention of
the same names ln the Libera, at the close of the Canon of the
mass, and to be regarded as the recital ofa few names, repre-
senting the whole company of the saint-s. On the supposition,
however, that it is an indication of locality‚ it may be observcd
that both the Old and the New Minsters of Winchester were
founded in honour of S. Many, S. Peter, and S. Paul.l If any
name were added, that of S. Andrew would perhaps be that most
naturally chosen in either house: for the name of S. Swithun
had probably not yet begun to appear in the dedication-title of
the Old Minster, and among the various titles given to the New
llfinster we do not find any which includes the name of S.
Grimbald‚ or that of S. Barnabas, till after the removalof the
monastery to Hyde.²
On the whole, then, the evidence fumished by the manu-
script itself seems to point to the following results :- ’
(1) That it is the work of a scribe of the Winchester school,
and was probably produced either in the Old or in the
N ew Minstcr of Winchester.
(2) That the main body of the contents of the MS. includes
nothing inconsistent with this view, and suggests the
New Minstcr, rather than the Old, as the house in
which the book was written

¹ This is stated in acharter of Edgar, probably of the year 974. See Birch,
cartularium Saxonicum, vol. iit p. 622. The original dedication of the New
Minstcr isreoorded in the liber Manastcrii de Hyda, p. 83.

² For a lin of these variations. see the Preface to the Register of New Minstcr,
p. viii S. Barnabas appears as one of the patrons of Hyde on the seal of the convent
in the thirteenth century. But he was probably not thus honoured until 1182. in

which year certain miraculous events are recorded as having talren place at Hyde,
