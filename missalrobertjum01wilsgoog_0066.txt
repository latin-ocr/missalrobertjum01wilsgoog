Of these sections the first is commonly found in Sacra-
mentaries of the date and character of the Jumieges manuscript,
though with occasional differences of arrangement. Apart from
the presence of additional masses, already mentioned, it may be
observed that the allocation of the votive masses to particular
days does not agree with that of the series in the Leofric Missal.

The second semion, again, is commonly represented in manu-
scripts os this class: but the order, number, and composition of
the masses may be said to vary a good deal. There is certaInly
agood deal of difference between this section of the Jumieges
MS. and the parallel section of the Leofric Missal, οι· of
Muratori's text: but the majority of the prayers which make
up the masses in the first are found in the parallel portions of
the other tw0.

The third sectionis made up of three parts, all of which
appear in the supplementary portion os Muratori's Sacramentary.
ln the Leofric Missal the forms for Ash Wednesday and Coena
Doarini are inserted in the Τ errrporale, those for a penitent at the
point of death in what may be called the supplementary part ol
the text.

Of the fourth section, the form Ad clen'cum faciendum,
the Oratio ad capillaturam and Oratio ad barbas tondendas
