The days marked with an asterisk are those for which Ott.
provides a Presace,¹ those marked with an “obelus'' are those
sor which a mass is found in Men.

In these masses Leolr. is for the most part in agreement
with Gem. and the same may be said of Men. with regard to
the seventeen masses which it contains. Leot'r. makes no
mention os S. Basilides in its mass ol SS. Cyrinus, Nabor‚ and
Nazarius, and includes S. Felix with SS. Simplicius, FaustInus,
and Beatrix. Mur. and Men. have a mass of S. Pancratius‚ but
make no mention of SS. Nereus and Achilleus,² while the mass
differs throughout t'rom that in Gem. and Leofr. The principal
differences between Leosr. and Gem. in the structure oi the
particular masses are the omission in the former of the Prelacc
of S. Vltus, and of the second Collect and Ad Vespermn of the
“ Nat. S. Benedicti,” which appear in Gem. In this mass the
Preface also differs. The mass os S. Maurice ln Leofr. hasa
Collect different from that in Gem., and lor the Invention os the

¹The Preface «sor S. Gorgonius appears in Muratori's text with the heading
⁸¹ Natale Sancti Georgii ”3 but the date shows that this is probably an error z another
Presace appears in Ott. sor S. George's Day on viii Kal. Mai.

² SS. Nereus and Achilleus are recognised in Ott.
