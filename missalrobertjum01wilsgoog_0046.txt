'Collect 101 the same day. Men. has only one Sunday mass.
agreeing with that for the second Sunday in Gem. The

Prefaces 101 both Sundays are in Ott
For the Vigil 01 the Epiphany Mur. provides no mass.

That in Leofr. has no Preface. Men. agrees with Gem.,
following R and S, which differ from V only in the Preface.
Ott. has the same Preface with Gem. Leofr. Men.1 In the mass
for the festival Gem. and Ott. have the same Preface which
appears in R and S, and also agree with these Gelasian books
in employing for the first Sunday after the festival the Pre-
face which in Leofr. Mur. Men. belongs to the festival itself.

Men. repeats this Preface on the first Sunday, and Gem. directs
its use also on the Octave. ln the masses for the six Sundays
after the Epiphany, Gem. has always a Super Populum, agreeing
in each case with R and S⁴ These masses in (Mur.) have no
Super Populum, Leofr. has none for the first Sunday, while Men.
has none 101 the fourth, and for the fifth and sixth has forms
different from those in Leofr. and Gem.' The Prefaces for
these Sundays in Gern. are arranged in an order rather different
from that in Ott. Men. Leofr., the Prefaces for the third and
fourth Sundays being exchanged. Leofr. differs frorn the
others in using for the first Sunday the Preface which Gem. 3ηά
Ort. employ 101 the festival. ’

The masses 101 septuagesima and the two Sundays which
follow are all in agreement with Mur. with the addition,¹ in each
case, of the Preface found in Ott. In (Mur.) the onlyPreface
for these days is that 101 Quinquagesima The corresponding
masses in Leofr. differ from those in Gem. only by the presence

¹ Two variatione 01 reading in this mass are perhaps worthy of special mention.
(a) In the Secret V has ut euru praesentibus sacrificiis immolemus ct sumamus, and
with this R S and Leofr. agree. Men. substitutes ut praesentibus illi for utrum
praesentibus. Gem. readsruru forrum. (bl ln the Preface V (which has this Preface
for the festival) reads iudex puerpera virginalis sulla, and S 1 agrees. R has puer-
perae, S 2 puerperii; Men. 011. 011111 puerpera virginalis and insert Damiuicae
apparitionis before iudex. Gem. also inserts Domiurrae apparitionis but reads
perpetua 101 puerpera, connecting virginalis with stella.

¹ For the sixth Sunday Men. (33 ouen) employs 33 Super Populum one of the
prayers which in R and S appear 33 Collects.
